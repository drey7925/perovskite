# Provides a simple default game, centered around exploration, small-scale resource
# collection, mining, building, etc. This game may expand over time.
#
# It also provides the following abstractions/functionality (WIP):
# * Recipe book for crafting/smelting
# * A basic furnate that follows the recipe book
# * A simple inventory UI with creative support and a crafting tool
# * Map generator implementation
# * Helpers for defining tools
# * Useful commands for game administration
default_game = []

# Provides a plugin for making digital circuits that have simple in-game behaviors. Still a WIP
circuits = []

# Provides a unified definition for colored blocks, so different plugins can interoperate with dyes and related.
# Still a WIP
colors = []

# If enabled, server will detect deadlocks and log them.
